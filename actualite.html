                        Initially the concept of timeshare appeared somewhere in the 1960’s in France. The principle of
                        a timeshare actually marketed the concept of ‘buying the hotel’ for vacationing. Indeed,
                        timeshare is a form of real estate ownership, more precisely vacation property ownership. The
                        owners divide the costs of running the resort and also the use of the place between themselves.
                        This timeshare concept was first applied to land-resorts, but nowadays, we have all kinds of
                        vacation properties, including houseboats. Houseboat timeshare works on a very simple
                        principle. All 52 weeks of the year are divided between the owners (usually there are 51,
                        considering that one week should remain for maintenance)! So they can own the resort on a 1/51
                        basis and can use the resort one week per year. Of course, one can buy as many houseboat
                        timeshares as he/she wants to. But maybe you neither have the budget to do that nor the time.
                        And spending your vacation in the same spot every year doesn’t seem to be such an exciting idea
                        too! Therefore, several companies have been founded who promote the idea of exchanging
                        timeshares. Thus being a timeshare owner helps you avail the opportunity to exchange the
                        existing timeshare with someone else to a more pleasant vacation on a different spot for a very
                        small fee. And so, with the houseboat timeshare you could spend less for a vacation that in
                        other conditions would end up costing you quite a fortune.
